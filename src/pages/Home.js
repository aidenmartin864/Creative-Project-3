        <h1>Welcome to The Riddler's Funhouse (for kids)!</h1>
        <p>
            After retiring from crime and vigilante murder in 2015, The Riddler was inspired by his friend, The Joker, to rebrand as a kid-friendly entertainer.
            Though his real name still remains a mystery (as he likes most things in life), The Riddler has written 4 children's picture books, entitled:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p class='bookTitle'>Secrets Are Fun, But We Don't Keep Secrets From Adults!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class='bookTitle'>Stop Hitting Me, Batman!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class='bookTitle'>Behind Bars is All Work and No Fun!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class='bookTitle'>Bats Aren't So Scary After All!</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            He has found great joy and success in writing these books, having since sworn to never return to crime. On this website, he hopes to catalog some of his favorite
